    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelau is a savory one-pot Trinidadian favorite. Meat including chicken, beef or pigtails is first browned using “burnt sugar”(little past caramelization point), to which rice, fresh herbs, peas or beans, veggies and coconut milk are added resulting in the most comforting of dishes. A superb marriage of protein, carb and veggies made in heaven.</p>

Drain well.To the chicken, add half of the green seasoning(reserve the other half), <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> onion, garlic, ketchup, salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to coat the chicken with the seasonings. Marinate fir at least an hour or overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a dry large deep heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add sugar and allow it to froth, expand, bubble and darken (but not black and smoking). If black start over.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Immediately add the seasoned chicken, stirring frequently to coat about 5mins. Stir in scallion, onion, remainder of green seasoning and celery. Cover and cook until 70% cooked, stirring occasionally, about 15mins.</li>

        <li>Rinse rice under running water until water runs clear. Drain and add the rice to the pot along with pigeon peas, carrots, chopped bell pepper, thyme and cook stirring for 3mins.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix canned coconut milk with 3 cups of hot water and add to pot enough to submerge by 1". Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the liquid comes to a boil, reduce heat to low or simmer, cover pot tightly with a cover and cook for about 30mins or until rice is cooked and all the liquid has evaporated. Stir midway to ensure that it is not sticking. Taste and add more salt if required.</li>
