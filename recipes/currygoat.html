    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Curried goat is another very popular dish/delicacy in Trinidad, as well as Jamaica. It does not boast of a mild curry like curried chicken, but at the same time the curry is not overpowering.</p>

        <li>3 tbsp Curry powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp Duck and goat curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Salt</li>
        <li> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup Green seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp Turmeric</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp Olive oil, extra virgin</li>
        <li>2 tsp Amchar masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced culantro</li>
        <li>6 Leaves culantro (bandhania, chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut goat into <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>" pieces or to your preference. Soak with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of lemon or lime juice, then rinse several times with water; rubbing the meat with your fingers to remove any slime. Drain all the liquid after.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Season goat meat with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of green seasoning, minced cilantro, sliced onion, 2tbs of minced garlic, hot pepper (optional), salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and place in refrigerator to marinate up to 24hrs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make curry mixture: In a small bowl mix curry powder, duck and goat curry powder, amchar masala, turmeric, 2tbs of green seasoning and a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of water. Then put it aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in medium heavy bottomed pot. Add reserved onion slices (and optional hot pepper) and cook until the edges are brown. Add curry mixture and cook 3-5mins until it's grainy, separates from the oil and is fragant.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add goat meat (reserve any liquid from the bowl), thyme sprigs and turn to coat with curry. Cook on medium heat for 3-5mins, stirring constantly. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook. Goat will release and cook in it's natural juices. Cook until it starts to stick to the pot and all the liquid has evaporated (takes 20-40mins), cook one minute more, stirring constantly, to develop some serious flavor. This is a good time to test for salt. Add more if needed. If the meat is fully cooked, add potatoes,if not go to next step.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add reserved marinating liquid and 6 cups of water (submerge the meat), bring to boil, reduce heat to gentle simmer and cook 1hr more--stirring every 15mins or so--until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened. If the liquid evaporates and the meat is still not tender enough for you, add a cup more of water and continue cooking until your desired tenderness is achieved. This can also be done in the pressure cooker. Stir in the potatoes when the meat is tender enough for you. Cover and cook until the potato is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened. Add water if necessary to create sauce and add salt if required.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Before taking off the heat, stirr in chopped culantro and extra cumin if so desired.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove thyme sprigs and serve/eat with dhalpourie or paratha roti!</li>
    </ol>
