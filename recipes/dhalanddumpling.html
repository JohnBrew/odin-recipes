    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a large dutch oven over high heat. Rinse dhal and add to pot along with whole garlic cloves, turmeric, carrot, celery, minced culantro and a whole hot pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook for 60-90mins or until the the split peas is fully cooked and smooth. Remove hot pepper and swizzle to help it get to a smooth consistency. Stir in minced culantro and taste. Add more salt if required. Also add more water if it has become too thick, keeping in mind that it will continue to thicken after the dumplings are added.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the split peas is cooking, add ingredients for dumpling in a bowl and mix to combine. Gradually add water and knead to form a soft dough. Sprinkle flour on clean work surface. Shape into a round ball, also known as loyah and allow it to rest until ready to use.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the dhal is a smooth consistency and you have added any extra water if required, roll out dough into a large, thin round and cut to make 1" squares or any size you prefer. Drop into dhal soup and cook for 10-15mins or until no longer raw.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To finish, heat oil in a small pot, add garlic and cumin seeds and cook until golden brown. Pour gently and gradually into the dhal soup, using a cover to prevent any splashing. Stir in chopped culantro and taste for salt. Serve hot in bowls!</li>
